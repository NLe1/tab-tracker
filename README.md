# tab-tracker

This is on-premise project that is built during the process of me learning Vue.js
I am not putting any copyrights term for this project for educational purpose

The project use mysql2 package and sequelite for ORM to abstract out the database config and set up. But I am planning to migrate
this to NoSQL such as MongoDB in the future.

Another reason for disclaiming the ownership of project mainly because of the use of data that I basically write some python script
to scrape the Internet (shout out to https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/ and google.com ) for letting me use your data.
